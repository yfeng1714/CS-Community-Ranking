# Operations Runbook

## Local foundation

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and replace placeholder secrets for any non-local environment.
2. Start PostgreSQL with `docker compose up -d postgres`.
3. Install with `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`.
4. Start the application with `pnpm dev`.
5. Check `/api/health/live` and `/api/health/ready`.

If the default host port `5432` is occupied, set `POSTGRES_PORT` to an available
port in `.env` and use the same port in `DATABASE_URL`. PostgreSQL continues to
listen on port `5432` inside the container.

## Health meaning

- Liveness failure means the Node process cannot answer HTTP.
- Readiness failure means validated application startup or PostgreSQL connectivity is unavailable.
- A DRAFT/FROZEN Edition is product state, not process unhealthiness.

Railway deployment, migrations, backup/restore, scheduled jobs, alerts, and incident procedures are
completed and tested in Milestone 9. This file must be expanded before staging approval.
